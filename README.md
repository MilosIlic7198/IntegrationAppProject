# IntegrationAppProject
Integration app for tracking clients integrations.

I made this app to practice javascript. 
The application uses mysql, express.js and ejs as a template engine. 
It follows MVC design pattern and uses json web token for user authentication, and also uses user roles as authorization for accessing pages.
